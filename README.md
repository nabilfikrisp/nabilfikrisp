# Hi, I’m Nabil 👋

I’m a **full-stack developer** with solid experience in **TypeScript frontend**, currently deepening my **backend and systems knowledge** to strengthen my full-stack skill set.

I learn best by building focused projects, measuring results, and documenting what I discover.

**Currently:** Frontend Engineer at **Datacakra**, contracted to **Bank BTN**.
